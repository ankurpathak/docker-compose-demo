#Rabbit
- Connection - TCP connection between Rabbit-Consumer/Producer
- Channel - Logical Connection on top of Conncetion
- Producer - Send messages to Exchange along with Routing Key
- Consumer - Rabbit pushes messages to Consumer
- Binding connects an Exchange with a Queue using Binding Key
- Excahnge - Routes messages to queue comparing Routing Key and Binding Key based
- Message distribution depends on Exchange Type:
    - Faneout - Ignores routing key and send messages to all queue it know
    - Direct - Routes messages to such queue where Routing Key = Binding Key Exactly
    - Topic - Allows wildcard in Routing Key(red.*) and partial maching with Binding Key(redkey)
    - Headers - Use Header of Message instead of Routing key to route Messages
- Default(Nameless) Exchange
    - Special default exchange for all Queues
    - Ignores Binding Key
    - Compares Routing Key with Queue name
    - Indirectly allows sending Messages directly to Queue
